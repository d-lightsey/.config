## Tasks

### OC_136. Design and implement `/remember` command for intelligent memory management
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Researched**: 2026-03-05
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_136_design_and_implement_remember_command_for_intelligent_memory_management/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Design and implement a `/remember` command that takes either a prompt or file path as input, learns what it can from what has been passed in, compares existing content in the `.opencode/context/memory/` files, conducts further research online if more information would be helpful, identifies key additions to make to the memory files in a natural and well-orchestrated way, then proposes these additions for the user to approve with interactive checkboxes.

**Key Features Required**:
1. **Input Handling**: Support both text prompts and file paths as input sources
2. **Content Analysis**: Extract key concepts, patterns, and important information from input
3. **Memory Comparison**: Compare against existing `.opencode/context/memory/` files to avoid duplicates and identify gaps
4. **Research Augmentation**: Conduct web research when additional context would strengthen the memory entry
5. **Interactive Approval**: Present proposed memory additions with checkboxes for user selection
6. **Natural Integration**: Additions should fit naturally into existing memory structure
7. **Orchestrated Workflow**: Well-designed flow from input → analysis → research → proposal → approval → storage

**Components to Create**:
- **Command**: `.opencode/commands/remember.md` - User-facing entry point with argument parsing
- **Skill**: `.opencode/skills/skill-remember/SKILL.md` - Validation and delegation logic
- **Agent**: `.opencode/agents/remember-agent.md` - Core execution agent for analysis and proposal

### OC_135. Enforce workflow command delegation to prevent direct implementation
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-03-05
- **Researched**: 2026-03-05
- **Revised**: 2026-03-05
- **Implemented**: 2026-03-05
- **Language**: meta
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_135_enforce_workflow_command_delegation_to_prevent_direct_implementation/reports/research-001.md), [research-002.md](OC_135_enforce_workflow_command_delegation_to_prevent_direct_implementation/reports/research-002.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-002.md](OC_135_enforce_workflow_command_delegation_to_prevent_direct_implementation/plans/implementation-002.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260305.md](OC_135_enforce_workflow_command_delegation_to_prevent_direct_implementation/summaries/implementation-summary-20260305.md)

**Description**: When the user types workflow commands like `/plan N`, `/research N`, or `/implement N`, the AI is currently executing these directly instead of routing them through the skill system with proper delegation to subagents. This causes the main agent to implement when it should only plan, or research when it should delegate. The root cause is missing command interception/routing infrastructure that should detect workflow commands and ensure they are processed by the appropriate skill with forked subagent delegation. Need to design and implement a command routing system that enforces proper delegation boundaries.

### OC_134. Fix workflow command header not showing task number and name
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-03-04
- **Language**: meta
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_134_fix_workflow_command_header_display/reports/research-001.md), [research-002.md](OC_134_fix_workflow_command_header_display/reports/research-002.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_134_fix_workflow_command_header_display/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](OC_134_fix_workflow_command_header_display/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)

**Description**: When running the workflow commands /research, /plan, /revise, or /implement, the header doesn't correctly show the task number and name. The header should display "OC_N. Task Name" at the beginning of the output to clearly identify which task is being processed, but this is currently not working. Need to identify the root cause and plan an elegant solution.

### OC_133. Fix planner agent not following plan-format.md specification
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-03-04
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_133_fix_planner_agent_not_following_plan_format_specification/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_133_fix_planner_agent_not_following_plan_format_specification/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](OC_133_fix_planner_agent_not_following_plan_format_specification/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)
- **Language**: meta

**Description**: When running `/plan 132`, the created plan file at `specs/132_create_context_loading_best_practices_guide/plans/implementation-001.md` fails to follow the format specified in `.opencode/context/core/formats/plan-format.md`. This has happened repeatedly despite multiple attempts to fix it. The root cause may be: (1) planner agent not loading the plan-format.md context, (2) planner agent loading context but not following it, (3) skill-planner not properly injecting context via <context_injection> blocks, or (4) general-implementation-agent not passing plan-format requirements to the planner subagent. The solution requires investigating the context loading chain from skill-planner → planner-agent → plan file creation to ensure the plan-format.md specification is actually being read and applied.

### OC_132. Create context loading best practices guide
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Research**: [research-001.md](132_create_context_loading_best_practices_guide/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](132_create_context_loading_best_practices_guide/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](132_create_context_loading_best_practices_guide/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)

**Description**: Document the "Push vs Pull" context loading strategy that was implemented in task 128. Create `docs/guides/context-loading-best-practices.md` explaining: (1) Push model - critical context injected directly into agent prompts via `<context_injection>` blocks in SKILL.md files, (2) Pull model - context loaded on-demand via @-references, (3) When to use each approach - Push for strict formats/rules that must be followed, Pull for optional documentation and code examples, (4) How to implement Push loading in skills with examples from skill-planner, skill-researcher, and skill-implementer. This guide will help future skill developers understand and apply the context loading patterns correctly.

### OC_131. Synchronize state.json, TODO.md, and plan files during /implement execution
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_131_sync_state_todo_plan_during_implementation/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_131_sync_state_todo_plan_during_implementation/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](OC_131_sync_state_todo_plan_during_implementation/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)

**Description**: When running `/implement OC_N`, the state.json, TODO.md, and plan implementation-NNN.md files become out of sync. The plan file tracks phase status ([NOT STARTED], [IN PROGRESS], [COMPLETED], [PARTIAL]) but these are not automatically updated during execution. The root cause is that the /implement command specification lacks real-time status tracking mechanisms. The solution requires adding phase status update steps to the implementation workflow: mark phase as [IN PROGRESS] when starting, [COMPLETED] when finished, [PARTIAL] when blocked. Additionally, when phases complete, the plan status summary should reflect overall progress. This ensures all three files (state.json for task metadata, TODO.md for task overview, plan.md for detailed phase tracking) remain synchronized throughout the implementation process.

### OC_130. Make .opencode system self-contained
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Research**: [research-001.md](130_make_opencode_self_contained/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](130_make_opencode_self_contained/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](130_make_opencode_self_contained/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)

**Description**: The .opencode system should be self-contained and not rely on references to .claude/ directories or files. Currently, files like `plan-format.md` are deprecated and claim to use Claude format specifications. The goal is to remove all references to `.claude/` within `.opencode/` and ensure `.opencode/` uses its own format specifications and is fully self-contained.

### OC_129. Fix plan format in implementation-001.md to follow plan-format.md standards
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Research**: [research-001.md](129_fix_plan_format_in_implementation_001_md/reports/research-001.md)
- **Research**: [research-002.md](129_fix_plan_format_in_implementation_001_md/reports/research-002.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](129_fix_plan_format_in_implementation_001_md/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](129_fix_plan_format_in_implementation_001_md/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)
- **Language**: meta

**Description**: The plan file /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/specs/128_ensure_task_command_only_creates_tasks_and_never_implements_solutions_automatically/plans/implementation-001.md was created with incorrect format. It contains `**Status**: [STATUS]` metadata lines after each phase heading instead of the correct format from plan-format.md which requires status markers ONLY in the phase headings (e.g., `### Phase N: Name [STATUS]`). Need to update the file to follow the standard format with status only in headings and no separate metadata lines per phase.

**Description**: Migrate /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/.opencode/OPENCODE.md into /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/.opencode/README.md to provide a single README.md file with systematic coverage of all features of the core .opencode/ agent system as well as the various extensions provided and cross links to relevant README.md files scattered throughout the subdirectories. Rename /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/.opencode/QUICK-START.md to INSTALLATION.md which should focus entirely on what is needed to install all dependencies.

### 126. Fix <leader>ao picker to load extensions into correct subdirectory
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](126_fix_ao_picker_extension_loading_path/reports/research-001.md)

- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260304.md](126_fix_ao_picker_extension_loading_path/summaries/implementation-summary-20260304.md)

**Description**: Fix the `<leader>ao` picker to load extensions into the correct `.opencode/agents/subagents/` subdirectory instead of directly into `.opencode/agents/`. Currently, when loading extensions via `<leader>ao` in `/home/benjamin/Projects/Logos/Theory/`, files are being placed at `.opencode/agents/formal-research-agent.md` instead of the desired `.opencode/agents/subagents/`. This functionality must be distinct from `<leader>ac` which should continue loading directly into `.claude/agents/`.

**Description**: Add an extension for conducting epidemiology research using R and any other standard software, MCP servers, agents, skills, and commands that would help to streamline the workflow. The same extension should be added to both .opencode/extensions/ and .claude/extensions/

### 87. Investigate terminal directory change when opening neovim in wezterm
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](087_investigate_wezterm_terminal_directory_change/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Investigate why the terminal working directory changes to a project root when opening neovim sessions in wezterm from the home directory (~). Determine whether this behavior is caused by neovim or wezterm (configured in ~/.dotfiles/config/). Identify if any functionality depends on this behavior before modifying it. Goal is to avoid changing the terminal directory unless necessary.

**Description**: Fix Gmail SMTP authentication failure when sending emails via Himalaya (<leader>me). Error: "Authentication failed: Code: 535, Enhanced code: 5.7.8, Message: Username and Password not accepted". The error occurs with TLS connection attempts and persists through multiple retry attempts. Identify and fix the root cause of the SMTP credential configuration.

### 72. Fix himalaya sidebar help showing leader keybindings that conflict with toggle selection
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix himalaya sidebar help display (shown via '?') incorrectly showing leader keybindings (`<leader>mA` - Switch account, `<leader>mf` - Change folder, `<leader>ms` - Sync folder) in the Folder Management section. These leader commands should not be accessible or defined in the sidebar since `<leader>` is `<Space>` which is used for toggle selections in that buffer.
