## Tasks

### OC_154. Task command fails to create entries - not a specs/ directory issue
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Status**: [RESEARCHING]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: The /task command fails to create task entries even when specs/ directory exists with TODO.md and state.json. Initial diagnosis assumed the issue was missing specs/ directory when copying .opencode/ to other directories, but the command also fails in the current directory where specs/ is present. This indicates a deeper issue with the task command implementation or the agent's interpretation of the command rules. The command file (.opencode/commands/task.md) exists and appears correct, yet task creation is not occurring.

**Revised Root Cause**: Unknown. The previous diagnosis (missing specs/ directory) is incorrect since the command fails even when specs/ exists. Potential causes:
1. Agent not properly following task.md command instructions
2. Task command not being invoked correctly by the system
3. Command parsing issues preventing /task from being recognized
4. Agent role confusion - agent diagnosing instead of creating

**Required Investigation**:
1. Verify /task command is being invoked correctly by the system
2. Check if task.md command is being loaded and parsed properly
3. Determine why agent is not executing the CREATE mode steps
4. Review agent behavior when /task is called vs other commands

### OC_153. Fix skill-implementer postflight not executing - status not updating after implementation
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_153_fix_skill_implementer_postflight_not_executing/reports/research-001.md) - Comprehensive analysis identifying that skill tool only loads definitions, doesn't execute workflows. Commands must implement preflight/postflight status updates themselves, not rely on skills to do it.
- **Plan**: [implementation-002.md](OC_153_fix_skill_implementer_postflight_not_executing/plans/implementation-002.md) - Revised 6-phase plan with clarifications: bug documentation, upgraded risk level, automatic status update success criterion
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix the issue where task status is not being updated to [COMPLETED] after implementation finishes. The root cause is that the skill tool only loads skill definitions but doesn't execute the skill workflow (preflight/postflight). After implementing OC_151, state.json still shows "planning", TODO.md shows [PLANNING], and the plan file header shows [NOT STARTED], even though all phases were completed and .return-meta.json was created correctly.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `/implement` command documents calling `skill` tool to "execute the implementation workflow"
- But `skill` tool only **loads** skill content, it doesn't **execute** the workflow
- The preflight/postflight stages defined in skill-implementer/SKILL.md never run
- Therefore state.json, TODO.md, and plan file status are never updated

**Artifacts**:
- [implementation-summary-20260306.md](OC_153_fix_skill_implementer_postflight_not_executing/summaries/implementation-summary-20260306.md) - Complete implementation summary documenting all 6 phases, technical details, and verification results

**Required Changes**:
1. Investigate how skills should actually be invoked to execute their workflow
2. Fix the `/implement` command to properly trigger skill-implementer postflight
3. Fix the `/plan` command to properly trigger skill-planner postflight  
4. Add missing postflight execution to complete status updates
5. Remediate OC_151 status manually (currently stuck at "planning")

**Files to Modify**:
- `.opencode/commands/implement.md` - Add actual postflight execution
- `.opencode/commands/plan.md` - Add actual postflight execution
- `.opencode/skills/skill-implementer/SKILL.md` - Clarify execution mechanism
- `.opencode/skills/skill-planner/SKILL.md` - Clarify execution mechanism
- `specs/state.json` - Fix OC_151 status
- `specs/TODO.md` - Fix OC_151 status
- `specs/OC_151_*/plans/implementation-001.md` - Fix header status

### OC_152. Fix git commit co-author attribution showing Claude Opus instead of actual model
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_152_fix_git_commit_co_author_attribution/reports/research-001.md) - Research report identifying 14 files with incorrect 'Claude Opus 4.5' co-author attribution that should be standardized to 'OpenCode'
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix git commit co-author attribution showing 'Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5' when using Kimi K2.5 in OpenCode. The commit messages incorrectly attribute co-authorship to Claude Opus when the actual model being used is Kimi K2.5. Need to investigate where this attribution is coming from and either correct it to reflect the actual model or remove it entirely.

**Artifacts**:
- [research-001.md](OC_152_fix_git_commit_co_author_attribution/reports/research-001.md) - Research report identifying 14 files with incorrect 'Claude Opus 4.5' co-author attribution

### OC_151. Rename /remember command to /learn
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_151_rename_remember_command_to_learn/reports/research-001.md) - Comprehensive research report identifying 47+ references to skill-remember and /remember across the OpenCode system. Categorized by priority and provided clean-break rename recommendations based on OC_142 precedent.

**Description**: Rename the /remember command to /learn throughout the OpenCode system. This involves updating the skill definition (skill-remember → skill-learn), command registration, and all documentation references.

**Artifacts**:
- [research-001.md](OC_151_rename_remember_command_to_learn/reports/research-001.md) - Comprehensive research report identifying 47+ references to skill-remember and /remember across the OpenCode system
- [implementation-001.md](OC_151_rename_remember_command_to_learn/plans/implementation-001.md) - 6-phase implementation plan for clean-break rename with no backward compatibility aliases

### 87. Investigate terminal directory change when opening neovim in wezterm
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](087_investigate_wezterm_terminal_directory_change/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Investigate why the terminal working directory changes to a project root when opening neovim sessions in wezterm from the home directory (~). Determine whether this behavior is caused by neovim or wezterm (configured in ~/.dotfiles/config/). Identify if any functionality depends on this behavior before modifying it. Goal is to avoid changing the terminal directory unless necessary.

### 78. Fix Himalaya SMTP authentication failure when sending emails
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [PLANNED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/plans/implementation-001.md)

**Description**: Fix Gmail SMTP authentication failure when sending emails via Himalaya (<leader>me). Error: "Authentication failed: Code: 535, Enhanced code: 5.7.8, Message: Username and Password not accepted". The error occurs with TLS connection attempts and persists through multiple retry attempts. Identify and fix the root cause of the SMTP credential configuration.

### 72. Fix himalaya sidebar help showing leader keybindings that conflict with toggle selection
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix himalaya sidebar help display (shown via '?') incorrectly showing leader keybindings (`<leader>mA` - Switch account, `<leader>mf` - Change folder, `<leader>ms` - Sync folder) in the Folder Management section. These leader commands should not be accessible or defined in the sidebar since `<leader>` is `<Space>` which is used for toggle selections in that buffer.
