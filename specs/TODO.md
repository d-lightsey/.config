## Tasks

### OC_146. Research and implement subagent workflow best practices
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None

*Description**: Research and implement best practices for using subagents with isolated context windows and careful metadata passing in the .opencode/ agent system. Currently all research is conducted by the primary agent rather than being delegated to research subagents. Need to investigate 2026 best practices for:

1. **Isolated Context Windows**: How to properly delegate to subagents with clean, isolated context to prevent context pollution and reduce token usage
2. **Metadata Passing**: Careful passing of task metadata (task number, description, requirements) between primary agent and subagents
3. **Result Aggregation**: How subagents should return structured results that can be properly integrated back into the primary agent's workflow
4. **Error Handling**: Best practices for handling subagent failures and fallbacks
5. **Integration with Skills**: How subagent delegation should work within the existing skill-based architecture (skill-researcher, skill-implementer, skill-planner)

**Key Findings**:
- **System Architecture**: Three-layer delegation (Command → Skill → Agent) is working correctly
- **Isolated Context**: Uses `context: fork` mode with Task tool and `<context_injection>` blocks for clean, isolated context windows
- **Metadata Passing**: File-based metadata exchange via `.return-meta.json` files is reliable and avoids console pollution
- **Result Aggregation**: Skills use postflight pattern to read metadata, validate artifacts, update state, and commit changes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive patterns with early metadata creation, validation gates, timeout handling, and fallback chains
- **Gap Identified**: Primary agent currently performs research directly instead of delegating to research subagents - this is the core issue to address
- **Report**: [specs/OC_146_research_implement_subagent_workflow_best_practices/reports/research-001.md](specs/OC_146_research_implement_subagent_workflow_best_practices/reports/research-001.md)

### OC_145. Restore settings.json format and state sync validation
- **Effort**: medium
- **Status**: [PENDING]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix the settings.json format change that removed critical PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks. The new format removed `permissions` object and validation hooks that ensured TODO.md and state.json stayed synchronized after writes. Need to restore either the old format or adapt the hooks to work with the new format. Without these hooks, state synchronization fails silently, causing TODO.md entries to not match state.json statuses.

**Key Issues to Fix**:
1. Restore PreToolUse hook that validates state.json writes before they happen
2. Restore PostToolUse hook that runs validate-state-sync.sh after state.json writes
3. Either restore the detailed permissions.allow/permissions.deny structure or ensure new format supports equivalent functionality
4. The `$schema` field was added - determine if this is required or optional

**Files to Modify**:
- .opencode/settings.json - Restore hooks and proper format
- May need to update .opencode/hooks/validate-state-sync.sh if format changed

### OC_144. Fix systemic metadata delegation across all skills
- **Effort**: large  
- **Status**: [PENDING]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_145 (if settings issues block testing)

**Description**: Implement systemic fix for metadata delegation across all 6 skill/agent pairs. Currently, when skills delegate to agents via Task tool, the `metadata_file_path` parameter is missing from the delegation prompt. This causes agents to not know where to write `.return-meta.json` files, which breaks the postflight artifact linking system. Without proper metadata files, TODO.md cannot be updated with Research/Plan/Summary links.

**Skills/Agents to Fix**:
1. skill-implementer → general-implementation-agent
2. skill-planner → planner-agent  
3. skill-meta → meta-builder-agent
4. skill-neovim-implementation → neovim-implementation-agent
5. skill-neovim-research → neovim-research-agent
6. skill-researcher → general-research-agent (see OC_143)

**Changes Required Per Skill**:
- Update Stage 3 delegation prompt to include metadata_file_path
- Add preflight validation that metadata_file_path is present
- Add postflight fallback logic when metadata files are missing
- Update agent documentation to require metadata_file_path validation

**Files to Modify**:
- .opencode/skills/skill-*/SKILL.md (6 files)
- .opencode/agent/subagents/*-agent.md (6 files)

### OC_143. Fix skill-researcher TODO.md linking regression
- **Effort**: medium
- **Status**: [PENDING]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_144 (part of systemic fix, but can be done separately)

**Description**: Fix the specific regression in skill-researcher where research reports are not being linked in TODO.md. Root cause is missing `metadata_file_path` parameter in the delegation prompt to general-research-agent. When the agent completes research, it doesn't know where to write the return metadata file, so postflight cannot extract artifact information to update TODO.md with the Research link.

**Changes Required**:
- Update skill-researcher Stage 3 delegation prompt to include metadata_file_path
- Add fallback logic in postflight for when metadata file is missing
- Update general-research-agent documentation to validate metadata_file_path
- May need to audit TODO.md and manually fix any missing Research links from past tasks

**Files to Modify**:
- .opencode/skills/skill-researcher/SKILL.md
- .opencode/agent/subagents/general-research-agent.md

### OC_142. Implement knowledge capture system
- **Effort**: large
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_143, OC_144 (need working metadata delegation first)

**Description**: Implement a comprehensive knowledge capture system with three integrated features that were lost when reverting. This system enables capturing, classifying, and organizing knowledge from completed tasks and codebase scans.

**Phase 1: Rename /learn to /fix (1-2 hours)**
- Rename command from `/learn` to `/fix` for clarity
- Rename skill from `skill-learn` to `skill-fix`
- Update all documentation references (8+ files)
- Update command description and user guides

**Phase 2: Add task mode to /remember (3-4 hours)**
- Add mode detection to /remember command (task mode vs content mode)
- Implement task artifact collection from specs/OC_N_{name}/ directories
- Create knowledge classification algorithm (context vs memory vs project intelligence)
- Build interactive checkbox picker for routing knowledge to appropriate destinations
- Update skill-remember to handle both modes
- Create templates for context/, memory/, and project-intelligence/ entries

**Phase 3: Enhance /todo with auto features (2-3 hours)**
- Add automatic CHANGE_LOG.md updates when archiving tasks
- Extract completion_summary from state.json for changelog entries
- Add memory suggestions picker using interactive checkbox pattern
- Create classification logic for determining what knowledge to suggest
- Integrate with skill-remember for memory creation

**Phase 4: Documentation and templates (1-2 hours)**
- Create knowledge capture documentation explaining the three commands
- Create templates for context/, memory/, PI file formats
- Document decision framework: when to use context vs memory vs PI
- Update user guide with examples

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- .opencode/commands/fix.md (rename from learn.md)
- .opencode/skills/skill-fix/SKILL.md (rename from skill-learn)
- .opencode/commands/remember.md (add task mode)
- .opencode/skills/skill-remember/SKILL.md (add task mode stages)
- .opencode/commands/todo.md (add changelog and memory features)
- .opencode/context/core/templates/context-pattern-template.md
- .opencode/docs/guides/user-guide.md (add knowledge capture section)
- Multiple README and guide updates

### OC_140. Document progressive disclosure patterns in context-loading guide
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_137 (completed)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_140_document_progressive_disclosure_patterns/reports/research-001.md) - Documentation needed for stage-progressive loading, conditional injection, discovery-layer pattern, context budgets, and troubleshooting
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_141_fix_agent_delegation_system_failure/plans/implementation-001.md) - 7-phase systematic audit and fix of skill-to-agent delegation

**Description**: Follow-up to OC_137 Phase 8. Update context-loading-best-practices.md with progressive disclosure patterns: stage-progressive loading, conditional context injection, discovery-layer pattern, context budget guidelines (keep under 800 lines), and troubleshooting section for context injection verification.

**Required Documentation**:
1. Stage-Progressive Loading Pattern - tiered loading by stage
2. Conditional Context Injection - when to inject vs when to skip
3. Discovery-Layer Pattern - context awareness without bloat
4. Context Budget Guidelines - measurable limits (800 lines, <10% for routing)
5. Troubleshooting - verifying context loading, debugging injection failures

### OC_139. Implement stage-progressive loading demonstration in skill-planner
- **Effort**: 1.5 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_137 (completed)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_139_implement_stage_progressive_loading_demo/reports/research-001.md) - Initial POC for progressive context loading in skill-planner
  - [research-002.md](OC_139_implement_stage_progressive_loading_demo/reports/research-002.md) - **Systematic review**: Comprehensive audit of all 11 skills with 30-60% optimization opportunities and 2026 best practices alignment
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_139_implement_stage_progressive_loading_demo/plans/implementation-001.md) - 3-phase implementation with 40-50% context reduction target

**Description**: Follow-up to OC_137 Phase 7. Implement stage-progressive context loading in skill-planner as proof-of-concept: load status-markers.md in Stage 1 (for preflight validation), defer plan-format.md and task-breakdown.md to Stage 3 (for plan creation). Expected ~40-50% reduction in initial context window usage.

**Systematic Review Findings** (from research-002.md):
- **Current**: 100% context loaded in Stage 1 across all skills
- **Opportunity**: Stage-progressive loading reduces initial context by 40-60%
- **Priority Skills**: skill-planner, skill-implementer, skill-meta (highest impact)
- **2026 Best Practices**: Checkpoint-based loading, context budget enforcement, conditional domain context

**Implementation**:
- Modify skill-planner/SKILL.md execution stages
- Stage 1: Load minimal context (status-markers only)
- Stage 2: Preflight validation
- Stage 3: Load format context (plan-format.md, task-breakdown.md)
- Stage 4: Delegate to planner-agent with full context

### OC_138. Fix plan metadata status synchronization
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_138_fix_plan_metadata_status_synchronization/reports/research-001.md) - Root cause: synchronization protocol only updates state.json and TODO.md, missing plan file line 4 metadata status
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_141_fix_agent_delegation_system_failure/plans/implementation-001.md) - 7-phase systematic audit and fix of skill-to-agent delegation

**Description**: Fix the three-way status synchronization gap identified during OC_136 implementation. When tasks complete, the plan file's line 4 status metadata (`- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]`) is not updated, while state.json and TODO.md are correctly synchronized. This creates confusion and has persisted through multiple previous fix attempts.

**Root Cause**: Plan files have TWO levels of status - plan-level (line 4) and phase-level (within phases). Current synchronization protocol (phase-synchronization.md) only addresses state.json, TODO.md, and phase-level statuses, completely missing the plan-level status on line 4.

**Required Changes**:
1. Update phase-synchronization.md protocol to include plan metadata status
2. Update skill-implementer/SKILL.md Stage 4 (Postflight) to update plan file line 4
3. Add verification step to ensure all three locations are synchronized

**Expected Outcome**: When a task completes, ALL three locations show completed status:
- state.json: `"status": "completed"` ✓
- TODO.md: `[COMPLETED]` ✓  
- Plan file line 4: `[COMPLETED]` ✓ (currently missing!)

### 87. Investigate terminal directory change when opening neovim in wezterm
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](087_investigate_wezterm_terminal_directory_change/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Investigate why the terminal working directory changes to a project root when opening neovim sessions in wezterm from the home directory (~). Determine whether this behavior is caused by neovim or wezterm (configured in ~/.dotfiles/config/). Identify if any functionality depends on this behavior before modifying it. Goal is to avoid changing the terminal directory unless necessary.

- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/plans/implementation-001.md)

**Description**: Fix Gmail SMTP authentication failure when sending emails via Himalaya (<leader>me). Error: "Authentication failed: Code: 535, Enhanced code: 5.7.8, Message: Username and Password not accepted". The error occurs with TLS connection attempts and persists through multiple retry attempts. Identify and fix the root cause of the SMTP credential configuration.

### 72. Fix himalaya sidebar help showing leader keybindings that conflict with toggle selection
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix himalaya sidebar help display (shown via '?') incorrectly showing leader keybindings (`<leader>mA` - Switch account, `<leader>mf` - Change folder, `<leader>ms` - Sync folder) in the Folder Management section. These leader commands should not be accessible or defined in the sidebar since `<leader>` is `<Space>` which is used for toggle selections in that buffer.
