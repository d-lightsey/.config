## Tasks


### OC_140. Document progressive disclosure patterns in context-loading guide
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_137 (completed)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_140_document_progressive_disclosure_patterns/reports/research-001.md) - Documentation needed for stage-progressive loading, conditional injection, discovery-layer pattern, context budgets, and troubleshooting
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_141_fix_agent_delegation_system_failure/plans/implementation-001.md) - 7-phase systematic audit and fix of skill-to-agent delegation

**Description**: Follow-up to OC_137 Phase 8. Update context-loading-best-practices.md with progressive disclosure patterns: stage-progressive loading, conditional context injection, discovery-layer pattern, context budget guidelines (keep under 800 lines), and troubleshooting section for context injection verification.

**Required Documentation**:
1. Stage-Progressive Loading Pattern - tiered loading by stage
2. Conditional Context Injection - when to inject vs when to skip
3. Discovery-Layer Pattern - context awareness without bloat
4. Context Budget Guidelines - measurable limits (800 lines, <10% for routing)
5. Troubleshooting - verifying context loading, debugging injection failures

### OC_139. Implement stage-progressive loading demonstration in skill-planner
- **Effort**: 1.5 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: OC_137 (completed)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_139_implement_stage_progressive_loading_demo/reports/research-001.md) - Initial POC for progressive context loading in skill-planner
  - [research-002.md](OC_139_implement_stage_progressive_loading_demo/reports/research-002.md) - **Systematic review**: Comprehensive audit of all 11 skills with 30-60% optimization opportunities and 2026 best practices alignment
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_139_implement_stage_progressive_loading_demo/plans/implementation-001.md) - 3-phase implementation with 40-50% context reduction target

**Description**: Follow-up to OC_137 Phase 7. Implement stage-progressive context loading in skill-planner as proof-of-concept: load status-markers.md in Stage 1 (for preflight validation), defer plan-format.md and task-breakdown.md to Stage 3 (for plan creation). Expected ~40-50% reduction in initial context window usage.

**Systematic Review Findings** (from research-002.md):
- **Current**: 100% context loaded in Stage 1 across all skills
- **Opportunity**: Stage-progressive loading reduces initial context by 40-60%
- **Priority Skills**: skill-planner, skill-implementer, skill-meta (highest impact)
- **2026 Best Practices**: Checkpoint-based loading, context budget enforcement, conditional domain context

**Implementation**:
- Modify skill-planner/SKILL.md execution stages
- Stage 1: Load minimal context (status-markers only)
- Stage 2: Preflight validation
- Stage 3: Load format context (plan-format.md, task-breakdown.md)
- Stage 4: Delegate to planner-agent with full context

### OC_138. Fix plan metadata status synchronization
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](OC_138_fix_plan_metadata_status_synchronization/reports/research-001.md) - Root cause: synchronization protocol only updates state.json and TODO.md, missing plan file line 4 metadata status
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](OC_141_fix_agent_delegation_system_failure/plans/implementation-001.md) - 7-phase systematic audit and fix of skill-to-agent delegation

**Description**: Fix the three-way status synchronization gap identified during OC_136 implementation. When tasks complete, the plan file's line 4 status metadata (`- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]`) is not updated, while state.json and TODO.md are correctly synchronized. This creates confusion and has persisted through multiple previous fix attempts.

**Root Cause**: Plan files have TWO levels of status - plan-level (line 4) and phase-level (within phases). Current synchronization protocol (phase-synchronization.md) only addresses state.json, TODO.md, and phase-level statuses, completely missing the plan-level status on line 4.

**Required Changes**:
1. Update phase-synchronization.md protocol to include plan metadata status
2. Update skill-implementer/SKILL.md Stage 4 (Postflight) to update plan file line 4
3. Add verification step to ensure all three locations are synchronized

**Expected Outcome**: When a task completes, ALL three locations show completed status:
- state.json: `"status": "completed"` ✓
- TODO.md: `[COMPLETED]` ✓  
- Plan file line 4: `[COMPLETED]` ✓ (currently missing!)

### 87. Investigate terminal directory change when opening neovim in wezterm
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](087_investigate_wezterm_terminal_directory_change/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Investigate why the terminal working directory changes to a project root when opening neovim sessions in wezterm from the home directory (~). Determine whether this behavior is caused by neovim or wezterm (configured in ~/.dotfiles/config/). Identify if any functionality depends on this behavior before modifying it. Goal is to avoid changing the terminal directory unless necessary.

### 78. Fix Himalaya SMTP authentication failure when sending emails
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/plans/implementation-001.md)

**Description**: Fix Gmail SMTP authentication failure when sending emails via Himalaya (<leader>me). Error: "Authentication failed: Code: 535, Enhanced code: 5.7.8, Message: Username and Password not accepted". The error occurs with TLS connection attempts and persists through multiple retry attempts. Identify and fix the root cause of the SMTP credential configuration.

### 72. Fix himalaya sidebar help showing leader keybindings that conflict with toggle selection
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix himalaya sidebar help display (shown via '?') incorrectly showing leader keybindings (`<leader>mA` - Switch account, `<leader>mf` - Change folder, `<leader>ms` - Sync folder) in the Folder Management section. These leader commands should not be accessible or defined in the sidebar since `<leader>` is `<Space>` which is used for toggle selections in that buffer.
