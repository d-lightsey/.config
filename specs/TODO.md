## Tasks

### 190. Investigate UX inconsistencies and improve command outputs
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-03-12
- **Research Completed**: 2026-03-12
- **Language**: meta
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](190_investigate_ux_inconsistencies_and_improve_command_outputs/reports/research-001.md), [research-002.md](190_investigate_ux_inconsistencies_and_improve_command_outputs/reports/research-002.md)

**Description**: Investigate UX inconsistencies throughout the .claude/ agent system (commands, skills, agents) in order to standardize the approach where it makes sense and otherwise improve the UX by making simplifications or additions as appropriate. Key known issues include: inconsistent "next step" suggestion formats across commands (some use `Next: /cmd N`, others use numbered lists, others use varied vocabulary like "Suggested", "Recommended", "Next Steps"); lack of a unified output formatting standard for command completions; and the finding that Claude Code's auto-suggest feature is not triggered by command output formatting (it's session-level) meaning users must type suggestions manually. The investigation should audit all commands for output consistency, identify other UX pain points, and propose/implement a clean, unified approach.

### 87. Investigate terminal directory change when opening neovim in wezterm
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](087_investigate_wezterm_terminal_directory_change/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Investigate why the terminal working directory changes to a project root when opening neovim sessions in wezterm from the home directory (~). Determine whether this behavior is caused by neovim or wezterm (configured in ~/.dotfiles/config/). Identify if any functionality depends on this behavior before modifying it. Goal is to avoid changing the terminal directory unless necessary.

### 78. Fix Himalaya SMTP authentication failure when sending emails
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [PLANNED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/plans/implementation-001.md)

**Description**: Fix Gmail SMTP authentication failure when sending emails via Himalaya (<leader>me). Error: "Authentication failed: Code: 535, Enhanced code: 5.7.8, Message: Username and Password not accepted". The error occurs with TLS connection attempts and persists through multiple retry attempts. Identify and fix the root cause of the SMTP credential configuration.

### 72. Fix himalaya sidebar help showing leader keybindings that conflict with toggle selection
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Fix himalaya sidebar help display (shown via '?') incorrectly showing leader keybindings (`<leader>mA` - Switch account, `<leader>mf` - Change folder, `<leader>ms` - Sync folder) in the Folder Management section. These leader commands should not be accessible or defined in the sidebar since `<leader>` is `<Space>` which is used for toggle selections in that buffer.
