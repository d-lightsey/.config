## Tasks

### 308. Implement adaptive context loading by extension and language
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: meta

**Description**: Implement adaptive context loading that filters by loaded extensions and task language. Currently, empty load_when conditions (empty arrays for agents/languages/commands) cause ALL context files to load unconditionally, regardless of task language. In the Vision project, a typst task loads ~24,444 lines of unrelated context (business-frameworks.md, legal-frameworks.md, pitch-deck-templates, etc.) because 74 core files have empty load_when. Fix this by: (1) Changing empty-array semantics so empty = never-load instead of always-load, requiring explicit 'always: true' for universal files; (2) Adding language-gate validation to the extension loader that warns when entries lack language filtering; (3) Adding a context budget system that caps total loaded lines and prioritizes by relevance (always > agent-match > language-match > command-match); (4) Making the skill/agent context loading queries filter OUT entries that don't match any active dimension rather than loading everything unfiltered. This is a meta task affecting .claude/context/, .claude/extensions/, .claude/agents/, and .claude/skills/.

### 87. Investigate terminal directory change when opening neovim in wezterm
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](087_investigate_wezterm_terminal_directory_change/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Investigate why the terminal working directory changes to a project root when opening neovim sessions in wezterm from the home directory (~). Determine whether this behavior is caused by neovim or wezterm (configured in ~/.dotfiles/config/). Identify if any functionality depends on this behavior before modifying it. Goal is to avoid changing the terminal directory unless necessary.

### 78. Fix Himalaya SMTP authentication failure when sending emails
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: [PLANNED]
- **Research Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Research Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Started**: 2026-02-13
- **Planning Completed**: 2026-02-13
- **Language**: neovim
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research**: [research-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](078_fix_himalaya_smtp_authentication_failure/plans/implementation-001.md)

**Description**: Fix Gmail SMTP authentication failure when sending emails via Himalaya (<leader>me). Error: "Authentication failed: Code: 535, Enhanced code: 5.7.8, Message: Username and Password not accepted". The error occurs with TLS connection attempts and persists through multiple retry attempts. Identify and fix the root cause of the SMTP credential configuration.
