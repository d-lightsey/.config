# Founder Implement Agent

## Overview

Executes founder implementation plans created by `founder-plan-agent`, generating detailed strategy reports (market sizing, competitive analysis, GTM strategy) in both markdown and professional PDF format. Uses phased execution with resume support, reading both the plan file and the original research report for full context. Phase 5 generates typst documents and compiles them to PDF in the `founder/` directory.

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
metadata_file="$metadata_file_path"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file")"
cat > "$metadata_file" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, loading plan and research"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "market_sizing_fintech_payments",
    "description": "Market sizing: fintech payments",
    "language": "founder"
  },
  "plan_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/plans/01_market-sizing-plan.md",
  "resume_phase": 1,
  "output_dir": "strategy/",
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "implement", "skill-founder-implement"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Load Plan and Research Report

**Read the plan file** and extract:
- Report type (market-sizing, competitive-analysis, gtm-strategy)
- Selected mode
- Research report reference (from "Research Integration" section)
- Phase list with status markers
- Gathered context from plan

**Read the research report** (referenced in plan):
```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"

# Find research report from plan or directory
research_report=$(ls "$task_dir/reports/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -f "$research_report" ]; then
  # Read research report for additional context
  research_content=$(cat "$research_report")
fi
```

**Why both files?**
- Plan contains the structured phases and success criteria
- Research report contains the raw data gathered through forcing questions
- Both are needed for complete context during implementation

### Stage 3: Detect Resume Point

Scan phases for first incomplete:
- `[COMPLETED]` -> Skip
- `[IN PROGRESS]` -> Resume here
- `[NOT STARTED]` -> Start here

If all phases `[COMPLETED]`: Task already done, return implemented status.

### Stage 4: Load Report Template

Based on report type, load appropriate template:

| Report Type | Template Path |
|-------------|---------------|
| market-sizing | `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/market-sizing.md` |
| competitive-analysis | `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/competitive-analysis.md` |
| gtm-strategy | `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/gtm-strategy.md` |

### Stage 5: Execute Phases

Execute each phase starting from resume point. Use context from BOTH plan and research report.

#### Phase 1: TAM Calculation (Market Sizing)

**For market-sizing reports:**

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]` in plan file

2. Extract inputs from gathered context (plan + research):
   - Entity count (from research: ### Market Data section)
   - Price point (from research: ### Market Data section)
   - Data sources (from research: ### Market Data section)

3. Select methodology based on mode:
   | Mode | Preferred Methodology |
   |------|----------------------|
   | VALIDATE | Bottom-Up |
   | SIZE | All three, compare |
   | SEGMENT | Bottom-Up per segment |
   | DEFEND | Bottom-Up (VCs prefer) |

4. Calculate TAM:
   - **Top-Down**: Industry report -> Market size -> Segment percentage
   - **Bottom-Up**: Entity count x Price point
   - **Value Theory**: Pain cost x Frequency x Affected entities

5. Document assumptions and sources

6. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]` in plan file

#### Phase 2: SAM Narrowing

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]`

2. Extract narrowing factors from research report:
   - Geographic constraints (### Geographic Scope section)
   - Segment exclusions (### Geographic Scope section)
   - Technical limitations

3. Apply filters to TAM:
   - Geographic filter: % of TAM in serviceable regions
   - Segment filter: % of entities you can actually serve
   - Calculate SAM = TAM x Geographic% x Segment%

4. Document each narrowing factor with rationale

5. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

#### Phase 3: SOM Projection

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]`

2. Extract capture rate assumptions from research report:
   - Year 1 target (### Capture Assumptions section)
   - Year 3 target (### Capture Assumptions section)
   - Competitive context (### Competitive Landscape section)

3. Calculate SOM:
   - SOM Y1 = SAM x Capture_Rate_Y1
   - SOM Y3 = SAM x Capture_Rate_Y3

4. Validate against competitive benchmarks

5. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

#### Phase 4: Report Generation

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]`

2. Generate report using template structure (see full template in original agent spec)

3. Write report to output location:
   ```bash
   # Default location, or use output_dir if provided
   output_path="${output_dir:-strategy/}${report_type}-${slug}.md"

   # Ensure directory exists
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_path")"

   # Write report
   write "$output_path" "$report_content"

   # Verify
   [ -s "$output_path" ] || return error "Failed to write report"
   ```

4. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

#### Phase 5: Typst Document Generation

**For all report types**, generate professional PDF output:

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]` in plan file

2. **Check typst availability**:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v typst &> /dev/null; then
     echo "WARNING: typst not installed, skipping PDF generation"
     # Mark phase as [PARTIAL] and continue
     return
   fi
   ```

3. **Select typst template** based on report type:
   | Report Type | Template Path |
   |-------------|---------------|
   | market-sizing | `.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/typst/market-sizing.typ` |
   | competitive-analysis | `.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/typst/competitive-analysis.typ` |
   | gtm-strategy | `.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/typst/gtm-strategy.typ` |

4. **Generate typst content** directly from gathered context:
   - Extract key data from research report and plan
   - Populate template function parameters
   - Generate complete .typ file with all sections

5. **Write typst file** to founder directory:
   ```bash
   # Create founder directory at repository root
   mkdir -p "founder"

   # Write typst file
   typst_file="founder/${report_type}-${slug}.typ"
   write "$typst_file" "$typst_content"

   # Verify file was written
   [ -s "$typst_file" ] || return error "Failed to write typst file"
   ```

6. **Compile to PDF**:
   ```bash
   # Get template directory for imports
   template_dir=".claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/typst"

   # Compile typst to PDF (imports resolved relative to template dir)
   cd "$template_dir"
   typst compile "$(pwd)/$typst_file" "founder/${report_type}-${slug}.pdf" 2>&1

   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Typst compilation failed"
     # Keep .typ file for debugging, mark phase [PARTIAL]
     return
   fi

   # Verify PDF exists and is non-empty
   [ -s "founder/${report_type}-${slug}.pdf" ] || return error "PDF generation failed"
   ```

7. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

**Typst Content Generation Pattern**:

For each report type, generate a complete typst file that imports the template and calls the document wrapper function with all gathered data. Example for market-sizing:

```typst
#import "strategy-template.typ": *

#show: market-sizing-doc.with(
  project: "{project_name}",
  date: "{ISO_DATE}",
  mode: "{mode}",
  summary: [{executive_summary}],
  problem-statement: [{problem}],
  target-customer: [{target}],
  customer-dimensions: ({dimensions_array}),
  tam-value: "{tam}",
  tam-methodology: "{methodology}",
  tam-calculation: [{calculation}],
  tam-sources: ({sources_array}),
  sam-value: "{sam}",
  sam-percent: "{sam_percent}",
  narrowing-factors: ({factors_array}),
  sam-calculation: [{sam_calculation}],
  som-values: ({som_array}),
  competitors: ({competitors_array}),
  assumptions: ({assumptions_array}),
  vc-checks: ({vc_checks_array}),
  validation-steps: ({validation_array}),
  opportunity-summary: [{opportunity}],
  why-now: ({why_now_array}),
)
```

**Error Handling for Phase 5**:

| Error | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Typst not installed | Skip Phase 5, log warning | [PARTIAL] |
| Template not found | Skip Phase 5, log error | [PARTIAL] |
| Compilation error | Keep .typ file, log error | [PARTIAL] |
| PDF empty | Keep .typ file, log error | [PARTIAL] |

Phase 5 failures do NOT block task completion. The markdown report (Phase 4) is the primary output.

### Stage 6: Generate Summary

Create summary in task directory:

```markdown
# Implementation Summary: Task #{N}
