## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
metadata_file="$metadata_file_path"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file")"
cat > "$metadata_file" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, loading plan and research"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "market_sizing_fintech_payments",
    "description": "Market sizing: fintech payments",
    "language": "founder"
  },
  "plan_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/plans/01_market-sizing-plan.md",
  "resume_phase": 1,
  "output_dir": "strategy/",
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "implement", "skill-founder-implement"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Load Plan and Research Report

**Read the plan file** and extract:
- Report type (market-sizing, competitive-analysis, gtm-strategy)
- Selected mode
- Research report reference (from "Research Integration" section)
- Phase list with status markers
- Gathered context from plan

**Read the research report** (referenced in plan):
```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"

# Find research report from plan or directory
research_report=$(ls "$task_dir/reports/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -f "$research_report" ]; then
  # Read research report for additional context
  research_content=$(cat "$research_report")
fi
```

**Why both files?**
- Plan contains the structured phases and success criteria
- Research report contains the raw data gathered through forcing questions
- Both are needed for complete context during implementation

### Stage 3: Detect Resume Point

Scan phases for first incomplete:
- `[COMPLETED]` -> Skip
- `[IN PROGRESS]` -> Resume here
- `[NOT STARTED]` -> Start here

If all phases `[COMPLETED]`: Task already done, return implemented status.

### Stage 4: Load Report Template

Based on report type, load appropriate template:

| Report Type | Template Path |
|-------------|---------------|
| market-sizing | `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/market-sizing.md` |
| competitive-analysis | `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/competitive-analysis.md` |
| gtm-strategy | `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/templates/gtm-strategy.md` |

### Stage 5: Execute Phases

Execute each phase starting from resume point. Use context from BOTH plan and research report.

#### Phase 1: TAM Calculation (Market Sizing)

**For market-sizing reports:**

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]` in plan file

2. Extract inputs from gathered context (plan + research):
   - Entity count (from research: ### Market Data section)
   - Price point (from research: ### Market Data section)
   - Data sources (from research: ### Market Data section)

3. Select methodology based on mode:
   | Mode | Preferred Methodology |
   |------|----------------------|
   | VALIDATE | Bottom-Up |
   | SIZE | All three, compare |
   | SEGMENT | Bottom-Up per segment |
   | DEFEND | Bottom-Up (VCs prefer) |

4. Calculate TAM:
   - **Top-Down**: Industry report -> Market size -> Segment percentage
   - **Bottom-Up**: Entity count x Price point
   - **Value Theory**: Pain cost x Frequency x Affected entities

5. Document assumptions and sources

6. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]` in plan file

#### Phase 2: SAM Narrowing

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]`

2. Extract narrowing factors from research report:
   - Geographic constraints (### Geographic Scope section)
   - Segment exclusions (### Geographic Scope section)
   - Technical limitations

3. Apply filters to TAM:
   - Geographic filter: % of TAM in serviceable regions
   - Segment filter: % of entities you can actually serve
   - Calculate SAM = TAM x Geographic% x Segment%

4. Document each narrowing factor with rationale

5. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

#### Phase 3: SOM Projection

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]`

2. Extract capture rate assumptions from research report:
   - Year 1 target (### Capture Assumptions section)
   - Year 3 target (### Capture Assumptions section)
   - Competitive context (### Competitive Landscape section)

3. Calculate SOM:
   - SOM Y1 = SAM x Capture_Rate_Y1
   - SOM Y3 = SAM x Capture_Rate_Y3

4. Validate against competitive benchmarks

5. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

#### Phase 4: Report Generation

1. Mark phase `[IN PROGRESS]`

2. Generate report using template structure (see full template in original agent spec)

3. Write report to output location:
   ```bash
   # Default location, or use output_dir if provided
   output_path="${output_dir:-strategy/}${report_type}-${slug}.md"

   # Ensure directory exists
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_path")"

   # Write report
   write "$output_path" "$report_content"

   # Verify
   [ -s "$output_path" ] || return error "Failed to write report"
   ```

4. Mark phase `[COMPLETED]`

### Stage 6: Generate Summary

Create summary in task directory:

```markdown
# Implementation Summary: Task #{N}

**Completed**: {ISO_DATE}
**Duration**: {time}
**Report Type**: {market-sizing|competitive-analysis|gtm-strategy}

## Changes Made

Generated {report type} for {topic}.

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Always initialize early metadata at Stage 0
2. Always read BOTH plan file AND research report for full context
3. Always update phase markers in plan file
4. Always use appropriate template for report type
5. Always include visualization (market diagram, positioning map)
6. Always generate executive summary
7. Always cite data sources from research report
8. Always include red flags / risks section
9. Always write metadata file before returning
10. Return brief text summary (not JSON)

**MUST NOT**:
1. Skip early metadata initialization
2. Generate numbers without sources from research
3. Skip reading research report (even if plan has context)
4. Skip red flags section
5. Return "completed" as status value (use "implemented")
6. Return JSON as console output
7. Leave phase markers in [IN PROGRESS] state
8. Skip summary artifact creation
