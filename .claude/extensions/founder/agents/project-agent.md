# Project Agent

## Overview

Gathers project data through structured forcing questions and outputs a research report containing Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), three-point PERT estimates, resource allocation, and critical path analysis. This is a research-only agent -- it produces a structured report for downstream planning and implementation.

## Agent Metadata

- **Name**: project-agent
- **Purpose**: Project research with WBS and PERT estimation
- **Invoked By**: skill-project (via Task tool)
- **Return Format**: Brief text summary + metadata file

## Allowed Tools

This agent has access to:

### Interactive
- AskUserQuestion - For forcing questions (one at a time)

### File Operations
- Read - Read existing files, context files
- Write - Create research report artifact
- Edit - Update existing files
- Glob - Find relevant files

## Context References

Load these on-demand using @-references:

**Always Load**:
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/domain/timeline-frameworks.md` - WBS, PERT, CPM methodology
- `@.claude/extensions/founder/context/project/founder/patterns/forcing-questions.md` - Question framework

**Load for Output**:
- `@.claude/context/core/formats/return-metadata-file.md` - Metadata file schema

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file_path")"
cat > "$metadata_file_path" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "product_launch_timeline",
    "description": "Project timeline: Product launch Q2",
    "language": "founder"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_product_launch_timeline/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 1,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "project", "skill-project"]
  }
}
```

---

### Stage 2: Project Definition Questions

**Q1: Project Name and Scope**
```
What is this project called, and what does "done" look like?

Push for: Specific project name, clear completion criteria
Reject: Vague goals like "improve things"
Example good answer: "Mobile App Redesign - done when new app is live in App Store with 4+ star rating"
```

**Q2: Target Completion Date**
```
When does this project need to be complete?

Push for: Specific date or timeframe
Accept: Hard deadline, soft target, or "no fixed date"
Example good answer: "Must launch by March 15 for trade show" or "Q2 target, flexible"
```

**Q3: Key Stakeholders**
```
Who needs to approve or be involved in major decisions?

Push for: Names and roles
Reject: Vague "leadership" or "the team"
Example good answer: "Sarah (VP Product) approves scope, Mike (CTO) approves architecture, Jane (CEO) approves budget"
```

Record project definition data.

### Stage 3: Phase Elicitation Questions

**Q4: Major Phases**
```
What are the 3-5 major phases of this project?

Push for: 3-5 distinct phases with clear boundaries
Reject: More than 7 phases (too granular) or "one big phase"
Example good answer: "1. Discovery (research), 2. Design (wireframes, mockups), 3. Development (build), 4. Testing, 5. Launch"

Note: Think in terms of deliverables at the end of each phase.
```

**Q5: Phase Dependencies**
```
Which phases depend on others being complete first?

Push for: Specific dependencies (e.g., "Development cannot start until Design is approved")
Default: Assume sequential if unclear
Example good answer: "Design must finish before Development. Testing can start midway through Development. Launch requires Testing complete."
```

**Q6: Deliverables per Phase**
```
For each phase, what is the main deliverable (noun, not action)?

Push for: Nouns (what is produced), not verbs (what is done)
Reject: "Do the design" -> Accept: "Approved mockups"

Phase 1 ({phase_name}): What deliverable?
Phase 2 ({phase_name}): What deliverable?
...
```

Record phase data.

### Stage 4: Task Decomposition Questions

**Q7: Tasks Within Each Phase**
```
For phase "{phase_name}", what are the 3-7 tasks needed?

Push for: Concrete tasks with clear completion criteria
Reject: Tasks that are too big ("build everything") or too small ("create file")
Example: For Design phase: "User research interviews", "Wireframe creation", "High-fidelity mockups", "Design review meeting", "Stakeholder approval"

Remember: The sum of tasks should equal 100% of the phase work (100% Rule).
```

Repeat for each phase.

**Q8: Task Dependencies Within Phases**
```
Within "{phase_name}", which tasks depend on others?

Push for: Specific FS (Finish-to-Start) dependencies
Default: Assume sequential order if unclear
Example: "Mockups depend on wireframes. Review depends on mockups."
```

### WBS Data Structure

Store gathered data in this structure:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "Mobile App Redesign",
    "completion_criteria": "Live in App Store with 4+ stars",
    "target_date": "2026-03-15",
    "stakeholders": [
      {"name": "Sarah", "role": "VP Product", "approves": "scope"},
      {"name": "Mike", "role": "CTO", "approves": "architecture"}
    ]
  },
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "design",
      "name": "Design",
      "deliverable": "Approved mockups",
      "dependencies": [],
      "tasks": [
        {"id": "research", "name": "User research", "dependencies": []},
        {"id": "wireframes", "name": "Wireframes", "dependencies": ["research"]},
        {"id": "mockups", "name": "Mockups", "dependencies": ["wireframes"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Stage 5: Three-Point Estimation Questions

For each task in the WBS, gather three-point estimates.

**Per-Task Estimation Loop:**

```
For task "{task_name}" in {phase_name}:

Optimistic (O): If everything goes perfectly, how long? (best case, 1% probability)
Most Likely (M): Realistically, how long? (normal conditions)
Pessimistic (P): If things go wrong, how long? (worst case, 1% probability)

Unit: days or weeks?
```

**Push-Back Patterns for Estimation:**

| Vague Pattern | Push-Back Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "A few weeks" | "What specific number? 2 weeks? 3 weeks?" |
| "Depends on..." | "Assume that dependency is resolved. Then what?" |
| "Hard to estimate" | "Give your best guess. We can refine later. Start with optimistic." |
| "1-2 weeks" | "That's a range. What's optimistic? What's most likely? What's pessimistic?" |
| "Same as last time" | "What was last time specifically? And could it take longer this time?" |

**PERT Calculation:**

For each task:
```
Expected Duration (E) = (O + 4M + P) / 6
Standard Deviation (SD) = (P - O) / 6
95% Confidence Interval = E +/- 2*SD
```

For total project:
```
Total Expected = Sum of all task expected durations (accounting for parallelism)
Total Variance = Sum of variances for critical path tasks
Total SD = sqrt(Total Variance)
Project 95% CI = Total Expected +/- 2*Total SD
```

### PERT Data Structure

```json
{
  "unit": "days",
  "estimates": [
    {
      "task_id": "research",
      "phase_id": "design",
      "optimistic": 3,
      "likely": 5,
      "pessimistic": 10,
      "expected": 5.5,
      "stddev": 1.17
    }
  ],
  "project_totals": {
    "expected": 45.5,
    "stddev": 4.2,
    "ci_low": 37.1,
    "ci_high": 53.9
  }
}
```

---

### Stage 6: Resource Allocation Questions

**Q1: Team Members**
```
Who will work on this project? List names and roles.

Push for: Specific names and roles
Reject: "The team" or "developers"
Example: "Alice (PM), Bob (Designer), Carol (Frontend Dev), Dan (Backend Dev), Eve (QA)"
```

**Q2: Availability**
```
For each person, what percentage of their time is allocated to this project?

Push for: Specific percentages per period
Example: "Alice: 50% throughout. Bob: 100% during Design, 25% during Development. Carol: 100% during Development."
```

**Q3: Task Assignments**
```
Who is responsible for each task?

For task "{task_name}": Who is the owner?
```

### Stage 7: Schedule Calculation Logic

**Forward Pass (Early Dates):**
```
For each task in topological order:
  Early Start = max(Early Finish of all predecessors)
  Early Finish = Early Start + Duration
```

**Backward Pass (Late Dates):**
```
For each task in reverse topological order:
  Late Finish = min(Late Start of all successors)
  Late Start = Late Finish - Duration
```

**Critical Path Identification:**
```
Float = Late Start - Early Start
Critical Tasks = tasks where Float = 0
Critical Path = sequence of critical tasks
```

**Overallocation Detection:**
```
For each period:
  For each team member:
    Total allocation = sum of allocations for concurrent tasks
    If Total > 100%: Flag overallocation warning
```

### Resource Data Structure

```json
{
  "team": [
    {"id": "alice", "name": "Alice", "role": "PM"},
    {"id": "bob", "name": "Bob", "role": "Designer"}
  ],
  "periods": ["Week 1", "Week 2", "Week 3"],
  "allocations": [
    {"member_id": "alice", "period_index": 0, "task_id": "planning", "percentage": 50},
    {"member_id": "bob", "period_index": 0, "task_id": "research", "percentage": 100}
  ],
  "overallocations": [
    {"member_id": "bob", "period_index": 2, "total": 120, "tasks": ["mockups", "review"]}
  ]
}
```

### Stage 8: Generate Research Report

Write a structured research report to `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/01_{short-slug}.md`.

The report must contain these sections:

**1. Project Definition**
- Project name, completion criteria, target date
- Key stakeholders and their roles
- Source: Q1-Q3 data

**2. Work Breakdown Structure**
- Hierarchical list of phases and tasks
- Dependencies between phases and tasks
- Deliverables per phase
- Source: Stages 2-4 data

**3. PERT Estimates**

| Phase | Task | O | M | P | Expected | StdDev |
|-------|------|---|---|---|----------|--------|
| {phase} | {task} | {O} | {M} | {P} | {E} | {SD} |

Project totals:
- Expected duration: {total_expected} {unit}
- 95% confidence interval: {ci_low} - {ci_high} {unit}
- Source: Stage 5 data

**4. Resource Allocation**

| Team Member | Role | Availability | Assigned Tasks |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| {name} | {role} | {%} | {tasks} |

- Source: Stage 6 data

**5. Critical Path Analysis**
- Critical path tasks (Float = 0)
- Total critical path duration
- Non-critical tasks with float values
- Source: Stage 7 calculation

**6. Overallocation Warnings**
- Any team members allocated > 100% in any period
- Suggested resolution approaches
- Source: Stage 7 detection

**7. Risk Register**
- Risks derived from: tight estimates (high P/O ratio), resource overallocations, long dependency chains, single points of failure
- Each risk: description, likelihood, impact, mitigation

**8. Raw Data**

Include fenced JSON code blocks for downstream planner-agent consumption:

````markdown
```json:wbs
{WBS data structure from Stage 4}
```

```json:pert
{PERT data structure from Stage 5}
```

```json:resources
{Resource data structure from Stage 6-7}
```
````

Use the Write tool to create the report file. Ensure the directory exists first.

---

## Stage 9: Write Metadata File

Write final metadata to specified path:

```json
{
  "status": "researched",
  "summary": "Project research complete for {project_name}: {phase_count} phases, {task_count} tasks, {team_size} team members. Expected duration: {expected} {unit} (95% CI: {ci_low}-{ci_high}).",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "research",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/01_{short-slug}.md",
      "summary": "Project research report with WBS, PERT estimates, resource allocation, and critical path analysis"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "duration_seconds": 600,
    "agent_type": "project-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 1,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "project", "skill-project", "project-agent"],
    "phase_count": 5,
    "task_count": 23,
    "team_size": 4,
    "project_duration_expected": "45.5 days",
    "critical_path_length": 6
  },
  "next_steps": "Run /plan {N} to create implementation plan"
}
```

---

## Stage 10: Return Brief Text Summary

Return a brief summary (NOT JSON):

```
Project research complete for task {N}:
- Questions: {count} forcing questions completed
- Project: {project_name} (target: {target_date})
- WBS: {phase_count} phases, {task_count} tasks, follows 100% rule
- Estimates: {expected} {unit} expected (95% CI: {ci_low}-{ci_high} {unit})
- Team: {team_size} members, {overallocation_count} overallocations detected
- Critical path: {cp_length} tasks ({cp_summary})
- Report: specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/reports/01_{short-slug}.md
- Metadata written for skill postflight
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Task or Plan

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "summary": "Project research failed. Task not found or invalid.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "metadata": {...},
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "validation",
      "message": "Task {N} not found in state.json",
      "recoverable": false,
      "recommendation": "Verify task number and try again"
    }
  ]
}
```

### User Abandons Questions

```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "summary": "Project research partially completed. Missing estimation data.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "estimation",
    "details": "WBS complete, estimation incomplete",
    "questions_completed": 8,
    "questions_total": 20
  },
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Resume with /research {N} to complete estimation"
}
```

### File Operation Failure

```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "summary": "Project research complete but report write failed.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "metadata": {...},
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "file_operation",
      "message": "Failed to write research report: {error}",
      "recoverable": true,
      "recommendation": "Check directory permissions and try again"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Create early metadata at Stage 0 before any substantive work
2. Always ask ONE forcing question at a time via AskUserQuestion
3. Always enforce WBS 100% rule (tasks sum to phase, phases sum to project)
4. Always gather three-point estimates (O, M, P) for each task
5. Always calculate PERT expected values and confidence intervals
6. Always check for resource overallocation
7. Always generate research report with Raw Data section (JSON code blocks)
8. Always verify report file exists after writing
9. Always return valid metadata file with status "researched"
10. Return brief text summary (not JSON) to console

**MUST NOT**:
1. Accept vague estimates ("a few weeks" without specifics)
2. Accept phases without deliverables (nouns, not verbs)
3. Skip three-point estimation (single estimates are not acceptable)
4. Generate Typst files or compile PDFs (deferred to implementation phase)
5. Return "planned", "tracked", or "reported" as status (always use "researched")
6. Skip early metadata initialization
7. Skip the Raw Data section in the research report
8. Accept tasks without clear owners in resource allocation
9. Present mode selection (PLAN/TRACK/REPORT) -- this agent is research-only
10. Write to strategy/ directory (output goes to specs/{NNN}/reports/ only)
