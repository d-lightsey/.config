# Founder Plan Agent

## Overview

Creates implementation plans for founder tasks (market sizing, competitive analysis, GTM strategy, contract review, project timelines) by reading research reports from the research phase. Uses the context gathered through forcing questions (already captured in the research report) to generate actionable implementation plans.

## Agent Metadata

- **Name**: founder-plan-agent
- **Purpose**: Create founder implementation plans from research reports
- **Invoked By**: skill-founder-plan (via Task tool)
- **Return Format**: JSON metadata file + brief text summary

## Allowed Tools

This agent has access to:

### File Operations
- Read - Read research reports, context files
- Write - Create plan artifact
- Glob - Find relevant files
- Bash - File verification

## Context References

## Execution Flow

### Stage 0: Initialize Early Metadata

**CRITICAL**: Create metadata file BEFORE any substantive work.

```bash
metadata_file="$metadata_file_path"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$metadata_file")"
cat > "$metadata_file" << 'EOF'
{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601 timestamp}",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "initializing",
    "details": "Agent started, parsing delegation context"
  }
}
EOF
```

### Stage 1: Parse Delegation Context

Extract from input:
```json
{
  "task_context": {
    "task_number": 234,
    "project_name": "market_sizing_fintech_payments",
    "description": "Market sizing: fintech payments",
    "language": "founder"
  },
  "metadata_file_path": "specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/.return-meta.json",
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "sess_...",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "plan", "skill-founder-plan"]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Locate and Read Research Report

**CRITICAL**: The plan is based on the research report, NOT interactive questioning.

```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"

# Find research report
research_report=$(ls "$task_dir/reports/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -z "$research_report" ]; then
  echo "Error: No research report found at $task_dir/reports/"
  echo "Run /research first to gather context"
  exit 1
fi
```

Read the research report and extract:
- Report type (market-sizing, competitive-analysis, gtm-strategy, project-timeline)
- Selected mode (from ## Summary or ## Findings section)
- All gathered context (problem definition, market data, competitors, positioning, etc.)

### Stage 3: Parse Research Report

### Stage 4: Determine Report Type

Identify report type from research report header or content:

| Keywords | Report Type | Template |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| market, sizing, TAM, SAM, SOM | market-sizing | market-sizing.md |
| competitive, competitor, analysis | competitive-analysis | competitive-analysis.md |
| GTM, go-to-market, strategy, launch | gtm-strategy | gtm-strategy.md |
| contract, legal, review, clause, liability, indemnification, negotiat | contract-review | contract-analysis.md |
| project, timeline, WBS, PERT, milestone, Gantt, deliverable, schedule, critical path | project-timeline | project-timeline.md |

Default to market-sizing if unclear.

### Stage 5: Generate Plan Artifact

Create plan in `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/plans/01_{short-slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Task #{N}

**Task**: {description}
**Version**: 01
**Created**: {ISO_DATE}
**Language**: founder
**Report Type**: {market-sizing|competitive-analysis|gtm-strategy|contract-review|project-timeline}
**Mode**: {mode from research report}

  - Inputs: Typst file from Phase 4
  - Objectives: Compile Typst to PDF, generate executive status summary if needed
  - Outputs: `strategy/timelines/{slug}.pdf`, optional executive summary
  - Verification: PDF generated successfully, all visualizations render correctly

**Note on Phase 5 naming for project-timeline**: Unlike other report types where Phase 5 is "Typst Document Generation", the project-timeline type names Phase 5 "PDF Compilation and Deliverables" because Typst generation happens in Phase 4 -- the Gantt chart and timeline visualizations ARE the primary Typst output. Phase 5 handles only the compilation step.

### Stage 6: Write Plan File

```bash
padded_num=$(printf "%03d" "$task_number")
task_dir="specs/${padded_num}_${project_name}"
mkdir -p "$task_dir/plans"

# Generate short-slug from description
short_slug=$(echo "$description" | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9-]//g' | cut -c1-30)

plan_file="$task_dir/plans/01_${short_slug}.md"
write "$plan_file" "$plan_content"

# Verify
[ -s "$plan_file" ] || return error "Failed to write plan file"
```

### Stage 7: Write Metadata File

Write final metadata to specified path:

```json
{
  "status": "planned",
  "summary": "Created {report_type} plan for {topic}. Integrated context from research report: {key_findings_summary}.",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "plan",
      "path": "specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/plans/01_{short-slug}.md",
      "summary": "{Report type} plan with research integration"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "{from delegation context}",
    "duration_seconds": 120,
    "agent_type": "founder-plan-agent",
    "delegation_depth": 2,
    "delegation_path": ["orchestrator", "plan", "skill-founder-plan", "founder-plan-agent"],
    "report_type": "{market-sizing|competitive-analysis|gtm-strategy|contract-review|project-timeline}",
    "mode": "{mode from research}",
    "phase_count": 5,
    "research_report": "{path to research report}",
    "estimated_hours": "2-4 hours"
  },
  "next_steps": "Run /implement to execute the plan and generate report"
}
```

### Stage 8: Return Brief Text Summary

Return a brief summary (NOT JSON):

```
Founder plan created for task 234:
- Report type: market-sizing, mode: SIZE
- Read research report: specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/reports/01_market-sizing.md
- Key context: Entity count 500K, price point $10K, geographic focus US/EU
- Plan: specs/234_market_sizing_fintech_payments/plans/01_market-sizing-plan.md
- 5 phases defined: TAM, SAM, SOM, Report Generation, Typst Document Generation
- Metadata written for skill postflight
```

## Research Report Integration

The founder-plan-agent does NOT ask forcing questions. Instead, it:

1. **Reads** the research report created by the research phase
2. **Extracts** all gathered context from the report structure
3. **Integrates** this context into the plan phases
4. **References** the research report in the plan's "Research Integration" section

This ensures:
- Forcing questions are asked ONCE (during research)
- Plan is based on actual gathered data, not assumptions
- Context flows seamlessly from research -> plan -> implement

---

## Error Handling

### No Research Report Found

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "summary": "Planning failed. No research report found for task.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Run /research first to gather context via forcing questions"
}
```

### Research Report Incomplete

```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "summary": "Created plan with incomplete context. Research report missing key sections.",
  "artifacts": [{...}],
  "partial_progress": {
    "missing_sections": ["Geographic Scope", "Capture Assumptions"]
  },
  "metadata": {...},
  "next_steps": "Review plan and supplement missing context, or re-run research"
}
```

---

## Critical Requirements

**MUST DO**:
1. Always read research report before creating plan
2. Always extract context from research report (not ask questions)
3. Always reference research report in plan's Research Integration section
4. Always store gathered context in plan file
5. Always determine report type from research report
6. Always generate 5-phase structure with Phase 5 as Typst Document Generation (except project-timeline)
7. Always name Phase 5 exactly "Typst Document Generation" (except project-timeline, which uses "PDF Compilation and Deliverables")
8. Always write valid metadata file
9. Return brief text summary (not JSON)

**MUST NOT**:
1. Ask forcing questions (that's done during research)
2. Skip reading the research report
3. Generate plan without research context
4. Return "completed" as status value (use "planned")
5. Skip metadata file creation
6. Return JSON as console output
