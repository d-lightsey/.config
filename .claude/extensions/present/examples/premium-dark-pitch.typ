#v(1em)

- *AI-generated phishing* increased 1,200% in 2025
- *Average breach cost*: \$4.9M per incident
- *Detection time*: 277 days average (attackers move in hours)

#v(1em)

*Recent Headlines*: Fortune 100 breached via AI-crafted spear phishing. Attackers used deepfake audio to authorize \$25M wire transfer.

#speaker-note[
  "The threat landscape has fundamentally changed. AI-generated attacks are up
  12x in the past year. The average breach costs nearly 5 million dollars.
  And here's the critical gap: attackers move in hours, but detection takes
  277 days on average. Traditional tools simply cannot keep up."
