  AI systems fail unpredictably in critical environments
]

#v(1em)

- *72% of enterprises* have halted AI deployments due to reliability concerns
- *\$4.2B lost* in 2025 from AI-related system failures
- Regulatory pressure mounting: EU AI Act requires safety verification

#v(1em)

*Real Example*: A major hospital's AI diagnostic system misclassified 23 critical cases in one week, causing \$12M in liability exposure.

#speaker-note[
  "Here's the core problem: AI systems are powerful but unpredictable.
  72 percent of enterprises we surveyed have stopped or paused AI deployments.
  The EU AI Act now requires formal safety verification for high-risk systems.
  Without reliable AI safety tools, enterprises can't deploy with confidence."

+ *Monitor* -- Real-time anomaly detection across model outputs
+ *Verify* -- Formal safety bounds with mathematical guarantees
+ *Intervene* -- Automatic fallback when confidence drops

#speaker-note[
  "SafeGuard is a three-part system. First, we monitor AI outputs in real-time.
  Second, we verify predictions against formal safety bounds.
  Third, we automatically intervene when the AI operates outside safe parameters.
  Think of it as seatbelts and airbags for AI systems."
